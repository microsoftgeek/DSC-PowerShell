# DSC Tokenization Example - With Token File
#
# This script supports using the technique where you simply
# create a copy of your web.config and add .token to the file
# extension.  This will result in two files in your target 
# folder (web.config and web.config.token)
#
# Using this technique the resource is able to determine
# if the target file matches the currently used tokens.
# For example if I used this resource and the database
# token was replaced with db01 and needed to update it to
# db02 the resource could figure out it needs to be reapplied
# Whereas if you don't use a token file the resource can't 
# determine that. All the resource can do if a token file is
# not used is simply see if the token still exist in the target
# file.  If not it must assume it has been run even if the value
# of the token has been changed sense the last time it was run.
#
# Running this example will create a new subfolder in the
# examples folder where the transformation of the files will
# take place.

# Define configuration data to be used in the configuration.
# This is normally done in a separate file but included here
# for this example.
